# Imperial Assault Skirmish Map Project

[New Orders](https://neworders.xyz) and [Board Wars](http://boardwars.eu/) podcasts are working together to bring you the Imperial Assault Skirmish Map Project. The project continues the lovely work started by Ibsh to create beautiful images for every Imperial Assault Skirmish Map. These maps serve two purposes:

1. Skirmish maps have been added to the Boardwars.eu [Imperial Assault Image DB](http://cards.boardwars.eu/index.php?album=Skirmish-Maps) where they can be searched and referenced.
2. Printable map groups are available for the current Imperial Assault tournament rotation as well as a full download of all the maps for printing.

*To use these maps you must own the indicated Fantasy Flight Games product.*

### Printing
These maps are created at 300 DPI so they can be easily printed at full size to make functional playmats.
![playmat photo](web_images/map-sample.jpg)

* **The most popular printouts:** [All currently available maps](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets/All2PlayerMaps) or [the current tournament maps](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets/TournamenRotationAnchorheadJabbaNalHutta).
* There is also a [printable map set for each wave](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets).
* Recommended shop & product: [PixArtPrinting PVC Banners](https://www.pixartprinting.com/signage/banners-mesh/pvc-banner/)
* PixArtPrinting *does* print 300 DPI JPGs (including the groups and single maps hosted here), even though their website asks for PDFs.
* The JPG files are very large so some people have trouble seeing them on their computer. Give them some time if you have an older computer.


### Background & Colophon
This project was started by Ibsh and popularized on [this FFG Thread](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186906-pre-assembled-skirmish-maps/). After Ibsh stepped away, he kindly passed the source files on Nick (nickv2002 on the forums and one of the hosts of the [New Orders podcast](https://neworders.xyz/)). Nick worked with Stephan at [Boardwars.eu](http://boardwars.eu/) to integrate with their [Imperial Assault Image DB](http://cards.boardwars.eu/). Stephan and EvadGonzo has also provided valuable help with image retouching on several map tiles from Jabba's Realm.

In addition to making high resolution maps, much care has gone into cleaning up these map images. The seams between tiles have been removed, but you’ll also find altered wording for clearer mission rules and some other subtle tweaks that we think improves the maps.

### Frequently Asked Questions
* **What about the other maps from the Jabba’s Realm Wave?** We’re working on these but the new tiles led to extra work and the handoff from Ibsh to Nick has slowed this down. If you're good with image-editing please get in touch!
* **What about the 4-Player maps?** These are a much lower priority, but if they're important to you please let me know and help out.
* **How can I create some other mix of printable maps?** Many [different map groups have been created](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets) already (this includes an incomplete group for Jabba’s Realm). Otherwise, the source code & files are all available as part of this GitHub project.
* **Who’s credited for making these maps?** *Jabba's Palace* and maps predating *Jabba’s Realm* were made by Ibsh. The few other were made by Nick with help from Ibsh’s original scans and tile-retouching from Stephan & EvadGonzo.
* **I found an mistake in the maps.** Please double check with the rules and original map insert. After confirming, please [Create an Issue](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/issues/new) on GitHub or let Nick know at the contact info below.
* **How can I help** If you're good with image-editing or have a flatbed scanner, please get in touch. Nick needs help cleaning up the imagery for the Jabba's Realm wave.
