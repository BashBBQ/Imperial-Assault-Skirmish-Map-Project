#Imperial Assault Printable Skirmish Maps

[New Orders](https://neworders.xyz) and [Board Wars](http://boardwars.eu/) podcasts are working together to bring you the Imperial Assault Skirmish Map Project. The project continues the lovely work started by Ibsh to create beautiful images for every Imperial Assault Skirmish Map. These maps serve two purposes:

1. Skirmish maps have been added to the Boardwars.eu [Imperial Assault Image DB](http://cards.boardwars.eu/index.php?album=Skirmish-Maps) where they can be searched and referenced.
2. Printable map groups are available for the current Imperial Assault tournament rotation as well as a full download of all the maps for printing.

#### Notes for Printing
* Recommended shop & product: [PixArtPrinting PVC Banners](https://www.pixartprinting.com/signage/banners-mesh/pvc-banner/)
* PixArtPrinting *does* print 300 DPI JPGs (created with this script) in addition to PDFs, even though they ask for PDFs initially.
* The JPG files are very large so some people have trouble seeing them on their computer. Give them some time if you have an older computer
* Questions? See [Boardwars](http://boardwars.eu/ia-maps/) and [New Orders](https://neworders.xyz/imperial-assault-skirmish-map-project/)
